# HTTP Server in C

i got no time to create a good readme

Its basically a use mess of string manipulation

this is a very bad implementation of a webserver written in C
if you want to test this with the test website:

```sh
make
```

and connect to http://0.0.0.0:8080/test_website/index.html or smh idk this server is super unsafe lol

## LSP and compilation databases
and if you wanna create a compilation db run the following:

```sh
#sudo apt install -y bear
#yes | sudo pacman -S bear
make clean; bear -- make all
```

## TOOD
forks and multi-threading and stuff
